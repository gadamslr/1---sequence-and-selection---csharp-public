## 1.7 VAT Calculator

Design and implement a program that allows the user to enter the price of an item.

The program calculates the amount of VAT to be paid at 20%. The VAT amount and total price are then displayed.

## Computational thinking

Using Computational thinking (CT) plan how you will solve this problem; first by filling in the **IPDO** table then by creating an algorithm using either Pseudocode or a Flowchart.

### IPDO table

Use the IPDO table to decide on what data needs to be Input, Output, How the input will need to be PROCESSED to get the required output.

Also does anything need to be stored when the program is not running?

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **INPUT** | **PROCESS** |
| Price of Item | VatAmount = price of item * (VAT / 100) |
| **DECISIONS** | **OUTPUT** |
| N/A | Item price</br>VAT amount</br>Total price |

</br>

Psuedocode here:

```text
DEFINE VAT = 20

INPUT priceOfItem

VatAmount = priceOfItem * (VAT / 100)

OUTPUT priceOfItem
OUTPUT VatAmount
OUTPUT Total price: (priceOfOItem + VatAmount)

```

Or

1. Create a flowchart using draw.io link: <https://app.diagrams.net/>
2. store the image on a shared area:

3. then add your image link here:

## Variables and Other Data Structures

| Name | Datatype | Typical Value | Minimum Value | Maximum Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| VAT | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| priceOfItem | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| VatAmount | --- | --- | --- | --- |

</br></br>

## Test Plan

Complete the first 2 columns of the following Test Plan BEFORE implementation. Add your own tests to the blank lines.

| Inputs | Expected Output | Actual Outputs | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|0.50 |  |  |  |
|50.00 |  |  |  |
|35.75 |  |  |  |
|£10.00 |  |  |  |
|Ten pounds |  |  |  |

## Implement your program!

### Hint:

You may need to use val() to get the value of the price entered

## Code

Use the method **static void VATCalculator()** in the [Program.cs](/1-sequence-and-selection---csharp/Program.cs) file to code this task.
