## 1.6 Form Chooser

Design and implement a program that allows the user to enter his/her name and form.

When run, the program greets the user by name and tells him/her which room to go to for registration.

| Form | Room |
| --- | --- |
| 9A | 103|
| 9B | 9|
| 9C | 101|
| 9D | 16 |

Eg:

- Inputs:
  - Ben, 9D

- Output:
  - Hello Ben, please go to Room 16

## Computational thinking

Using Computational thinking (CT) plan how you will solve this problem; first by filling in the **IPDO** table then by creating an algorithm using either Pseudocode or a Flowchart.

### IPDO table

Use the IPDO table to decide on what data needs to be Input, Output, How the input will need to be PROCESSED to get the required output.

Also does anything need to be stored when the program is not running?

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **INPUT** | **PROCESS** |
| student name</br>Form |  |
| **DECISIONS** | **OUTPUT** |
| if Form	then Room</br>
9A	103</br>
9B	9</br>
9C	101</br>
9D	16 | Hello **student name**, please go to Room **number** |

</br>

Psuedocode here:

```text
START
  INPUT student name
  INPUT form

  IF form == 9A THEN
    roomNumber = 103
  ELIF form == 9B THEN
    roomNumber = 9
  ELIF form == 9C THEN
    roomNumber = 101
  ELIF form == 9D THEN
    roomNumber = 16

  OUTPUT "Hello **student name**, please go to Room **number**"
END

```

Or

1. Create a flowchart using draw.io link: <https://app.diagrams.net/>
2. store the image on a shared area:
   - [I recommend imgur <https://imgur.com/>
3. then add your image link here:

## Variables and Other Data Structures

| Name | Datatype | Typical Value | Minimum Value | Maximum Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| studentName | string | "Jack Jones" | --- | --- |
| form | string | 9A | --- | --- |
| roomNumber| integer | 1 | --- | --- |

</br></br>

## Test Plan

Complete the first 2 columns of the following Test Plan BEFORE implementation.

Add your own tests to the blank lines.

Include valid and invalid data.

| Inputs | Expected Output | Actual Outputs | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| |  |  |  |

## Explain these terms:

```text
Selection:

Alternative Route:

Error Checking:

Valid data:

Invalid data:

Validation:

```

## Implement your program!

### Hint:

You may choose to use one of the following statements:

```text
If
  ...
Then
  ...
End If
```

or:

```text
Select
  ...
Case
   ...
End Select
```

## Code

Use the method **static void FormChooser()** in the [Program.cs](/1-sequence-and-selection---csharp/Program.cs) file to code this task.
