## 1.3 AreaCalc

Design and implement a program that allows the user to enter 2 numbers representing the width and length of a rectangle.

The program calculates and displays the area of the rectangle.

**THIS TIME*** you will pass ARGUMENTS into the PARAMETERS for method **static double AreaCalc(double num1, double num2)**.

## Computational thinking

Using Computational thinking (CT) plan how you will solve this problem; first by filling in the **IPDO** table then by creating an algorithm using either Pseudocode or a Flowchart.

### IPDO table

Use the IPDO table to decide on what data needs to be Input, Output, How the input will need to be PROCESSED to get the required output.

Also does anything need to be stored when the program is not running?

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **INPUT** | **PROCESS** |
| Width</br>Length | area = width * height |
| **DECISIONS** | **OUTPUT** |
| n/a | area |

</br>

Psuedocode here:

```text
START
	INPUT width
	INPUT length
	areaCalc = width * height
	OUTPUT areaCalc
END

```

Or

1. Create a flowchart using draw.io link: <https://app.diagrams.net/>
2. store the image on a shared area:

3. then add your image link here:

## Variables and Other Data Structures

| Name | Datatype | Typical Value | Minimum Value | Maximum Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| width | float | 1| 0.01 | 100.111 |
| length | float | 1 | 0.01 | 100.111 |

## Test Plan

Complete the first 2 columns of the following Test Plan BEFORE implementation. Add your own tests to the
blank lines.
| Inputs | Expected | Output | Actual | Outputs | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|2, 3|  |  |  |  |  |
|100, 100|  |  |  |  |  |
|4.2, 1.8|  |  |  |  |  |
|1m, 3|  |  |  |  |  |

## Implement your program!

What is the difference between an integer and a real number?

```text
```

Use the method **static double AreaCalc(double num1, double num2)** in the [Program.cs](/1-sequence-and-selection---csharp/Program.cs) file to code this task.

## Testing

Use the table above to identify any issues with your program
