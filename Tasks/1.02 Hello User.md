## 2. Hello User

Design and implement a program that allows the user to enter his/her name.

When run, the program displays “Hello user”, where user is the name entered.

## Computational thinking

Using Computational thinking (CT) plan how you will solve this problem; first by filling in the **IPDO** table then by creating an algorithm using either Pseudocode or a Flowchart.

### IPDO table

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **INPUT** | **PROCESS** |
|  userName | concatinate string and userName |
| **DECISIONS** | **OUTPUT** |
|  |  "Hello username"|

</br>

Psuedocode here:

```text
Pseudocode here:
START
   INPUT username
   OUTPUT "Hello" + username 
END
```

Or

1. Create a flowchart using draw.io link: <https://app.diagrams.net/>
2. store the image on a shared area:
   - [I recommend imgur <https://imgur.com/>
3. then add your image link here:

</br></br>

## Variables and Other Data Structures

| Name | Datatype | Typical Value | Minimum Value | Maximum Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| userName | string | abcd | "" | --- |
| welcome | string | --- | --- | --- |

</br></br>

## Explain these terms

```text
String:

Concatenation:

```

## Implement your program!

Use the method **static void HelloUser()** in the [Program.cs](/1-sequence-and-selection---csharp/Program.cs) file to code this task.
