## 1.9 Mini-Calc

Design and implement a program that allows the user to enter 2 numbers and choose a mathematical operation (+ - * /).

The program calculates the result and displays the answer as a full equation (eg the user enters 4 and 10 and chooses +).

The program displays 4 + 10 = 14

NB: the interface does NOT have to look like a calculator!

## Computational thinking

Using Computational thinking (CT) plan how you will solve this problem; first by filling in the **IPDO** table then by creating an algorithm using either Pseudocode or a Flowchart.

### IPDO table

Use the IPDO table to decide on what data needs to be Input, Output, How the input will need to be PROCESSED to get the required output.

Also does anything need to be stored when the program is not running?

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **INPUT** | **PROCESS** |
| num1, num2, operator | num1 + num2, num1 - num2, num1 / num2, num1 * num2|
| **DECISIONS** | **OUTPUT** |
| Operator type | result |

</br>

Psuedocode here:

```text
INPUT num1
INPUT num2
INPUT operator

IF operator == "+" THEN
   result = num1 + num2
ELSE IF operator == "-" THEN
   result = num1 - num2
ELSE IF operator == "*" THEN
   result = num1 * num2
ELSE IF operator == "/" THEN
   result = num1 / num2
ELSE
   OUTPUT "Invalid input"

OUTPUT result

```

Or

1. Create a flowchart using draw.io link: <https://app.diagrams.net/>
2. store the image on a shared area:

3. then add your image link here:

## Variables and Other Data Structures

| Name | Datatype | Typical Value | Minimum Value | Maximum Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| num1 | FLOAT | --- | --- | --- |
| num2 | FLOAT | --- | --- | --- |
| operator | STRING | --- | --- | --- |
| result | FLOAT | --- | --- | --- |

## Test Plan

Complete the first 2 columns of the following Test Plan BEFORE implementation.

Add your own tests to the blank lines.

| Inputs | Expected Output | Actual Outputs | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|4, 10, + |  |  |  |
|4, 10, - |  |  |  |
|4, 10, * |  |  |  |
|40, 10, / |  |  |  |
|25.5, 5, / |  |  |  |
|100000, 10000, \* |  |  |  |
|10,0, / |  |  |  |
|10, , + |  |  |  |
|Ten, 4, + |  |  | |

## Implement your program!

### Hint:

You may need to use val() to get the value of the numbers entered
You may choose to use a drop-down list for the 4 mathematical operations.

## Testing

Use the table above to identify any issues with your program

Why do the first 4 tests use the same numbers?

```text

```

What is the purpose of the 6th test in the test plan?

```text

```

### Code

Use the method **static void MiniCalc()** in the [Program.cs](/1-sequence-and-selection---csharp/Program.cs) file to code this task.
