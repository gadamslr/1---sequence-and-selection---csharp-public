## 1.4 PerimeterCalc

Design and implement a program that allows the user to enter 2 numbers representing the width and length of a rectangle.

The program calculates and displays the perimeter of the rectangle.

## Computational thinking

Using Computational thinking (CT) plan how you will solve this problem; first by filling in the **IPDO** table then by creating an algorithm using either Pseudocode or a Flowchart.

### IPDO table

Use the IPDO table to decide on what data needs to be Input, Output, How the input will need to be PROCESSED to get the required output.

Also does anything need to be stored when the program is not running?

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **INPUT** | **PROCESS** |
| Width</br>Length  | perimeter = (width + length) * 2 +  |
| **DECISIONS** | **OUTPUT** |
| Add any decisions here: | perimeter |

</br>

Psuedocode here:

```text
START
   INPUT width
   INPUT length
   perimeter = width * length
   OUTPUT perimeter
END


```

Or

1. Create a flowchart using draw.io link: <https://app.diagrams.net/>
2. store the image on a shared area:

3. then add your image link here:

## Variables and Other Data Structures

| Name | Datatype | Typical Value | Minimum Value | Maximum Value |
| width | float | 0.1 | 0.00001 | --- |
| length | float | 0.1 | --- | --- |
| perimeter | float | 0.1| --- | --- |

## Test Plan

Complete the first 2 columns of the following Test Plan BEFORE implementation.

Add your own tests to the blank lines.

| Inputs | Expected Output | Actual Outputs | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|2, 3|  |  |  |
|100, 100|  |  |  |
|4.2, 1.8|  |  |  |
|1m, 3|  |  |  |
|1, 3m|  |  |  |

## Implement your program!

### Testing
Use the table above to identify any issues with your program

What is the purpose of the 4th and 5th tests in the test plan?

```text
```

### Code

Use the method **static void PerimeterCalc()** in the [Program.cs](/1-sequence-and-selection---csharp/Program.cs) file to code this task.

### Commiting your code

Add a comment to explain what you have done, for example:
