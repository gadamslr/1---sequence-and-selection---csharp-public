# 1 Sequence and Selection - Csharp

In this assignment you will be developing your Sequence and Selection programming skillls with the C# programming language.

Tasks can be found in the **TASKS** folder, but all your code will now be written in the [Program.cs](/1-sequence-and-selection---csharp/Program.cs) file, each task will be completed in its own **METHOD** a type of subroutine.
